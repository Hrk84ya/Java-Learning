# Java-Learning

Welcome to the **Java-Learning** repository! This project is designed to help beginners and intermediate learners explore the world of Java programming through hands-on examples. It contains a collection of Java code snippets and projects, ranging from basic concepts to advanced topics, providing a structured path for you to improve your Java skills.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to serve as a learning resource for anyone who wants to learn Java. Whether you're a beginner just starting out, or you have some programming experience and want to dive deeper into Java, you'll find useful examples and exercises here.

## Key Features

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Start with basic Java syntax and gradually progress to more complex topics.
- **Structured Learning**: Examples and code are organized in a way that helps you learn concepts step-by-step.
- **Wide Coverage**: Topics range from basic operations to advanced concepts like object-oriented programming, collections, and multithreading.
- **Code Comments**: Code snippets are well-commented to explain the key concepts.

## Prerequisites

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Before you can run the Java code, you'll need to install the Java Development Kit (JDK). You can download the latest version from the official [Oracle JDK website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use an open-source JDK such as [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
  
  You do not need any other tools or frameworks to run the code; simply having JDK installed is enough.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Install JDK**:
   - Download and install the Java Development Kit (JDK) for your operating system from the official [Oracle JDK download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html) or use [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/).
   - After installation, verify that JDK is correctly installed by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:
     ```bash
     java -version
     ```
     This should output the installed version of Java.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   - Clone the `Java-Learning` repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Hrk84ya/Java-Learning.git
     ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   - Go to the folder containing the Java files:
     ```bash
     cd Java-Learning
     ```

4. **Compile and Run Code**:
   - For each code example, you can compile and run the Java files directly from the terminal or command prompt. Example:
     ```bash
     javac HelloWorld.java   # Compiles the Java file
     java HelloWorld         # Runs the compiled Java class
     ```

## Learning Path

The repository is organized into folders by topics, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. Hereâ€™s a suggested learning path:

1. **Basic Syntax and Data Types**  
   - Simple examples of Java syntax, variables, data types, and basic input/output.

2. **Control Flow**  
   - Learn about if-else statements, loops (for, while), and switch-case.

3. **Functions/Methods**  
   - Writing and calling methods, understanding parameters and return values.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
   - Dive into classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

5. **Collections Framework**  
   - Learn about Arrays, ArrayLists, HashMaps, and other data structures in Java.

6. **Exception Handling**  
   - Handling errors and exceptions with try-catch blocks.

7. **Multithreading**  
   - Explore multithreading concepts and how to handle multiple threads in Java.

8. **Advanced Topics**  
   - Deep dive into concepts like Java Streams, Lambdas, and JavaFX.

## Example Code Snippets

Here is an example of a simple Java program from the repository:

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
